# Build a Build Script
# One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of your source code. Sometimes your private source code may contain developer resources or private information that you don’t want to release in the published version.

# In this project, you’ll create a release script to copy certain files from a source directory into a build directory. 

#!/bin/bash
echo "Build script"
firstline=$(head -n 1 source/changelog.md)
read -a splitfirstline <<< $firstline
version=${splitfirstline[1]}
echo "The version you are building is" $version
echo 'Do you want to continue? Enter "1" for yes, "0" for no '
read versioncontinue
if [ $versioncontinue -eq 1 ]
then
  echo "OK"
  for filename in source/*
  do
    echo $filename
  done
  if [ "$filename" == "source/secretinfo.md" ]
  then
    echo "Not copying" $filename
  else
    echo "Copying" $filename
    cp $filename build/.
  fi
else
  echo "Come back when you are ready"
fi
cd build/
# We'll add more code here later
cd ..
echo "Build version $version contains:"
ls
